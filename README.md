# portfolio-site-v1.0

![portfolio-gif](assets/portfolio%20gif.gif)

## Description

I wanted to create this webpage as a starting point to showcase my upcoming projects through class as well as my own projects. It is nowhere near completed as this is just framework that I will be improving on as I learn more skills. Eventually I would want this page to be more functional, interactive and have alot more content. This helps me have a page for myself that I can start adding things to, and hopefully one day use as a tool to pursue new avenues in my career.
